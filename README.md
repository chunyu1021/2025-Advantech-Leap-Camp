## Tips and Pitfalls for Installing Edge Agent

### Before Installation‚Ä¶

- Check BSP version of your MIC-733
  - Only JetPack 6.0 is verified
- Prepare at least 200 GB NVMe SSD and install it on MIC-733
- Connect your MIC-733 with Internet

### During Installation‚Ä¶

- Why we need to install Docker?
  - Edge Agent and most of its components are running in Docker containers.
- Why we need to migrate Docker directory to SSD?
  - Models will be downloaded to Docker directory while using Edge Agent. We use extra SSD to hold the storage-demanding Docker directory.
- [Highly recommended verifying Docker directory is moving to SSD](https://github.com/advantech-EdgeAI/edge_agent/wiki/Test-Docker-on-SSD)
- "Download Essential Data" will take 5 to 10 minutes, be patient.
- Essential Data includes:
  - Demo data (images, videos, etc.)
  - Preset projects
  - Entire Edge Agent service (approx. 30 GB)

### After Installation‚Ä¶

- If you find MIC-737 entering emergency mode after rebooting‚Ä¶
  - Press "Ctrl + D" to continue entering system
  - Remove a redundant file (`sudo rm -rf /etc/udev/rules.d/70-nvme.rules`)
- To start Edge Agent:
  - By script: `bash startEA.sh`
  - [Manually](https://github.com/advantech-EdgeAI/edge_agent?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-start-edge-agent-manually)
- Plug in your USB camera before you start the Edge Agent.
- Use Chrome (or Chromium) to run Edge Agent
